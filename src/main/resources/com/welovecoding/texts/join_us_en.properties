text=<p><b>You love to code and watch tutorials?</b><br/>Then let's do it together!</p><p><b>We Love Coding</b> is based on the idea that <b>many people</b> can achieve a lot and reach a broader audience together. When searching the internet, we realised there are many bloggers who write <b>little 'How-to-guides'</b> but don't have enough visitors to look at them. We want to bring them together. We want to build up a website to enable bloggers and screencasters to write easy to the point articles to present them to a joint audience.</p><p>You got a cool bit of code or an interesting programming approach? Share it with us and <b>become an author</b> at We Love Coding! Doing it together brings twice as much fun and twice as much visitors. <h:outputText value="&#9786;" /></p><p>Who solely likes to code and would be rather into joining a community project without stress or deadlines can log in at ours as well. We're looking for lot's of <b>Java and JavaScript developers</b> to improve our platform and apps. Our code is available on GitHub (<nobr><a href="https://github.com/bennyn/wlc-webapp" class="highlight" target="_blank">wlc-webapp</a></nobr>) and we do Skype calls in the evening to discuss our architecture and exchange best practices.</p><p>So what are you waiting for?</p><p><b>Drop us few lines:</b><br/><a href="mailto:&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#064;&#119;&#101;&#108;&#111;&#118;&#101;&#099;&#111;&#100;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;?subject=Hello%20World!">info@welovecoding.com</a></p>
